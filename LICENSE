You are responsible for the security of Your password and for any use of Your account. You also agree to notify us promptly of any unauthorized use of Your username, password, other account information, or any other breach of security that You become aware of involving or relating to the Service or Software.

If there is a fee associated with your use of the Service or Software, You agree to pay that fee. The fee charged excludes all applicable taxes and currency exchange settlements, unless stated otherwise. You are solely responsible for paying such taxes or other charges.

6. Unauthorized Use

You agree to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with and assist AlphaWeighted in identifying and preventing any unauthorized use, copying, or disclosure of the Service or the Software.

7. AlphaWeighted Proprietary Rights

AlphaWeighted and any of its licensors own all proprietary rights in and to the Service and the Software. The Service and any Software provided to you is licensed and not sold. Except as expressly provided herein, AlphaWeighted retains all rights and does not grant any express or implied right to You under any AlphaWeighted patents, copyrights, trademarks, or trade secret information.

8. Modification and Termination of the Service

AlphaWeighted may place limits on, modify, suspend or terminate the Service generally, may remove or disable access to any content posted by You in using the Service and may suspend or terminate Your use of the Service or terminate this Agreement at any time, including as a result of Your use of the Service that AlphaWeighted reasonably deems to be excessive, which may include usage that substantially and repeatedly exceeds the typical levels of usage by other users of same category/tier of Service. If AlphaWeighted terminates the Service, Your use of the Service or this Agreement, the rights and licenses granted to You under this Agreement shall immediately terminate (except that You may continue to use any Software as provided in Section 2(ii) in all instances other than termination of this Agreement as a result of Your breach) and You shall immediately cease using the Service. In addition to those provisions that survive according to their terms, Sections 3 through 15 shall continue to be effective after termination of this Agreement. If AlphaWeighted terminates the Service, Your use of the Service or this Agreement, the rights and licenses granted to You under this Agreement shall immediately terminate (except that You may continue to use any Software licensed on a perpetual basis as provided in Section 2 in all instances other than termination of this Agreement as a result of Your breach) and You shall immediately cease using the Service. In addition to those provisions that survive according to their terms, Sections 3 through 15 shall continue to be effective after termination of this Agreement.

9. Changes to this Agreement

AlphaWeighted may change this Agreement and will post the modified agreement (which shall then become the Agreement) on AlphaWeighted’s website. Therefore, AlphaWeighted encourages you to check the terms of this Agreement from time to time to see if they have been updated. If You do not agree to the modified agreement, Your sole recourse is to stop using the Service and/or Software. Your continued use of the Service or Software after the date the modified agreement is posted will constitute Your acceptance of the modified agreement.

10. Indemnification by AlphaWeighted

During the Term, AlphaWeighted shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless Licensee and its officers, directors, employees, Users, successors and assigns, from and against any and all losses, damages, liabilities, settlements, reasonable costs and expenses resulting from or arising out of any third-party claim, demand, or cause of action which alleges that the Licensed Products infringe any duly issued patent, copyright or trademark or misappropriate any trade secret right of a third party (“Claim”). Licensee shall provide AlphaWeighted with prompt written notice of any Claim and permit AlphaWeighted to control the defense, settlement, adjustment or compromise of such Claim. Licensee shall have no authority to settle any Claim on behalf of AlphaWeighted. In addition, in the event use of the Licensed Products during the Term becomes, or in AlphaWeighted’s reasonable opinion is likely to become, the subject of a claim of infringement as outlined in this Section 10, AlphaWeighted may, at its option and expense: (a) obtain for Licensee the continuing right to use such Licensed Products; or (b) modify the Licensed Products or replace them with a substantially functional equivalent so that they no longer infringe; or (c) if neither (a) nor (b) is reasonably practicable, terminate Licensee’s license to such allegedly infringing Services and/or Software and refund to Licensee any unused pre-paid fees paid to AlphaWeighted, in which case this Agreement and Licensee’s right to use the Services and/or Software will terminate. This Section 10 states AlphaWeighted’s entire liability and Licensee’s exclusive remedy with respect to any claim of intellectual property infringement.

11. Indemnification by Licensee

You will defend, indemnify and hold harmless AlphaWeighted, its affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, licensors and any third-party providers, from and against all claims, losses, damages and costs, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, arising from any third-party claim against AlphaWeighted related to Your use of the Service or Software, including any document or content You submit to the Service.

12. Exclusion of Warranties

LICENSEE ACKNOWLEDGES AND UNDERSTANDS THAT THE SERVICE AND ANY SOFTWARE MAY CONTAIN ERRORS, OMISSIONS, AND PROBLEMS. LICENSEE HEREBY ACCEPTS THE SERVICE AND SOFTWARE, "AS IS" AND WITH ALL FAULTS, DEFECTS AND ERRORS AND LICENSEE UNDERSTANDS THAT IT ASSUMES ALL RISKS OF USE, QUALITY, AND PERFORMANCE. NEITHER ALPHAWEIGHTED NOR ANY OF ALPHAWEIGHTED'S LICENSORS MAKE ANY EXPRESS WARRANTIES, AND EACH OF THEM DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF ACCURACY, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

13. Limitation of Liability

LICENSEE AGREES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT NEITHER ALPHAWEIGHTED NOR ANY OF ITS LICENSORS MAY BE HELD LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, LOSS, DAMAGES, EXPENSES OR COSTS OF AN INDIRECT NATURE, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL OR SPECIAL DAMAGES, LOST PROFITS OR OTHERWISE AND IN NO EVENT SHALL THEY BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES IN EXCESS OF THE AMOUNT OF FEES PAID TO ALPHAWEIGHTED BY LICENSEE (IF ANY) UNDER THIS AGREEMENT DURING THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING SIX MONTHS. THIS LIMITATION APPLIES TO ALL CAUSES OF ACTION OR CLAIMS IN THE AGGREGATE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, BREACH OF CONTRACT, BREACH OF WARRANTY, INDEMNITY, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, MISREPRESENTATION AND OTHER TORTS. THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION APPLY TO YOU ONLY TO THE EXTENT THEY ARE LAWFUL IN YOUR JURISDICTION.

THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS INTENDED TO APPLY WITHOUT REGARD TO WHETHER OTHER PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT HAVE BEEN BREACHED OR HAVE PROVEN INEFFECTIVE OR IF A REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IF THE ABOVE LIMITATION WERE NOT INCLUDED HEREIN, ALPHAWEIGHTED WOULD NOT LICENSE THE SERVICE OR SOFTWARE TO YOU.

14. General Legal Terms

This Agreement is the entire agreement between You and AlphaWeighted related to the Service and/or Software, replacing any prior agreements. AlphaWeighted's licensors may be third party beneficiaries to this Agreement. There are no other third-party beneficiaries to this Agreement. The parties to this Agreement are independent contractors, and nothing in this Agreement creates an agency, partnership, or joint venture. You shall not assign this Agreement, by operation of law or otherwise. AlphaWeighted may assign this Agreement, subject to all of the terms of this Agreement.

Failure to enforce any provision will not constitute a waiver of that provision. If any provision of this Agreement is found unenforceable, it and any related provisions will be interpreted to best accomplish the unenforceable provision's essential purpose and, in any event, the remainder of the Agreement shall be unaffected. The prevailing party in any action or proceeding to enforce its rights hereunder shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys’ fees and other reasonable costs incurred in the action or proceedings.

You may only resolve disputes with AlphaWeighted on an individual basis, and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action.

This Agreement shall be governed by United Kingdom law without regard to any conflict of laws principles.
